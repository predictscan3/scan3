In a terminal:

To to the folder above where you want to keep the code, then:

$ git clone https://github.com/predictscan3/scan3.git

This will create a "scan3" folder.

To make it easy to find the data files, create a softlink.  Do this from the same folder that you ran the git command from.

For me this looks like:

$ ln -s /Users/luke/Dropbox/Citi\ and\ SGUL_shared\ folder data 

Then run the dev env test script

$ cd scan3
$ python test_dev_setup.py
