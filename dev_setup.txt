In a terminal:

To to the folder above where you want to keep the code, then:

$ git clone https://github.com/predictscan3/scan3.git

This will create a "scan3" folder.

Set up git so that you can commit to the main repo, edit the email address to be the same one as your github account:

$ git config --global --edit


To make it easy to find the data files, create a soft link.  Do this from the same folder that you ran the git command from.

On my mac this looks like:

$ ln -s /Users/luke/Dropbox/Citi\ and\ SGUL_shared\ folder data 

On my PC this looks like:

$ C:\Users\QZ\PycharmProjects>MKLINK /J data "c:\Users\QZ\Dropbox\Citi and SGUL_shared folder"

Then run the dev env test script:

$ cd scan3
$ python test_dev_setup.py
